# PhilFood
Generate random menus from over a decade of Phil LaRocca's cooking.

I built a simple UI using Flask + MongoDB for tagging out raw menu text with individual dishes, then wrote functions to turn that data into inputs for a JavaScript random generator, plus a timeline visualization built in d3.
